	* src/pmgr_collective_client.c : Added pmgr_check_tree call to check state
	  of tree.  Implements an allreduce using the tree and exits if any process
	  detects a failure.  Created packet protocol for tree, supporting either
	  collective packets or abort packets.

2009-06-15 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/pmgr_collective_common.c : Changed pmgr_malloc error printf from
	  %d to %lu for byte count (bug) and added %m to get reason for failure.

2009-04-16 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* LICENSE.TXT,
	  src/*,
	  test/client.c : Added BSD license info for open source release.

2008-06-25 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/pmgr_collective_mpirun.c,
	  src.pmgr_collective_client.c : Added static keyword to all variables and
	  functions used within a file to prevent exposing these symbols as external
	  in the library.

2008-06-18 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/pmgr_collective_client.c : Added ability to run as a single-task job
	  if MPIRUN_* variables are not found in environment.  This gives a way
	  to run job serially without needed mpirun or srun.
	  Added scatter tree when scattering from rank 0.
	  Rewrote debug levels so that rank 0 prints for 1-3, ranks 0 and N-1 print
	  for 4-6, and all ranks print for 7-9.
	  At debug level 3, environment variables values are printed to stdout.
	  Added error messages for failed read/write from client to mpirun process.
	  Added error messages for failed read/write to parent and children processes.
	  Creates a psuedo unique id by combining bits from the timestamp seconds and
	  the pid for a 1 task job.

	* src/pmgr_collective_mpirun.c : Adjusted error messages to make them more
	  uniform.

	* src/pmgr_collective_common.c : Added errors messages to pmgr_read_fd()
	  and pmgr_write_fd().

2008-05-19 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/pmgr_collective_client.c : Use rand_r() instead of srand() to avoid
	  overwriting random seed a user may have specified (from OSU).

2008-05-18 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/pmgr_collective_client.c : Added IP:port info to error message
	  on failed connect to track down bad hardware faster.

2008-01-28 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* test/client.c : Added data correctness test for each collective.

2008-01-23 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/pmgr_collective_mpirun.c : Replaced tab indents with spaces (code cleanup).

2008-01-22 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/pmgr_collective_client.c : Integrated patch from Chris Morrone
	  to poll on connection and retry with backoff on configurable
	  timeout.  The default TCP timeout was causing problems at 8192+
	  task counts.

	* PMGR_COLLECTIVE.README : Added note about pmgr_connect variables.

2008-01-11 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/pmgr_collective_client.h,
	  src/pmgr_collective_client.c : Dropped hostname string list
	  from pmgr_init and corresponding MPIRUN_PROCESSES and
	  NOT_USE_TOTALVIEW variables.  Added pmgr_allgatherstr to assist
	  user in gathering this info through PMGR_COLLECTIVE calls.
	  Added pmgr_allreducemaxint as a utility for pmgr_allgatherstr.

	* test/client.c : Removed hostlist parameter from call to pmgr_init.

	* test/mpirun_rsh.c : Removed code which sets MPIRUN_PROCESSES and
	  NOT_USE_TOTALVIEW.

	* PMGR_COLLECTIVE.README : Removed documentation about MPIRUN_PROCESSES
	  and NOT_USE_TOTALVIEW.

2008-01-03 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/pmgr_collective_common.h,
	  src/pmgr_collective_common.c,
	  src/pmgr_collective_client.c,
	  src/pmgr_collective_mpirun.c : Moved pmgr_gettimeofday and pmgr_getsecs
	  to common.

	* src/pmgr_collective_common.c : Added debug statements to time pmgr_* calls.

2008-01-02 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* makefile : Moved *.h files to src directory.  Have make copy them
	  to include directory on build.

	* src/pmgr_collective_client.c,
	  src/pmgr_collective_mpirun.c : Added filename and line number info
	  to pmgr_error messages.

	* src/pmgr_collective_mpirun.c : Added timers to debug statements.

	* src/pmgr_collective_common.h,
	  src/pmgr_collective_common.c : Added debug levels to pmgr_debug().

	* test/mpirun_rsh.c : Added to test pmgr_processops functionality.

	* test/client.c : Added pmgr_barrier() test.

	* PMGR_COLLECTIVE.README : Added readme to describe pros and cons
	  of current implemenation and to document build-time and run-time
	  options.

2007-12-28 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : cleaning up code and adding more info to error messages.
